USER INSTRUCTIONS:

To choose image files to represent the pieces, put them in a folder in the same directory as the JAR file. That folder will then show up in the "view-->themes" menu for the program.

Name images like so: "pawnwhite"


If you're using "back" and "front" themes for each color, simply add the words "back" or "front" to each image. 
For example, "pawnwhite.txt" becomes "pawnwhiteback", or "pawnfrontwhite", or "backwhitepawn", etc.
