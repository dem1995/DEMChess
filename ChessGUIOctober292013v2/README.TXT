USER INSTRUCTIONS:

To use your own image files, put them in a folder in the same directory as the JAR file. That folder will then show up in the "view-->themes" menu for the program.

THIS PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK not work without at least one valid set of valid images named "Pokémon"

Name images like so: "pawnwhite"

If you're using "back" and "front" themes for each color, simply add the words "back" or "front" to each image. 
For example, "pawnwhite.txt" becomes "pawnwhiteback", or "pawnfrontwhite", or "backwhitepawn", etc.
